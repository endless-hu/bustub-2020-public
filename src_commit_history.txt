    This completes the B+Tree Index.
    1. `BPlusTree::Remove()` should stop when the tree is empty.
       `FindLeafPage()` will notify `Remove()` this by returning a
       nullptr.
    2. Enhanced the `b_plus_tree_concurrent_test`. Added more rigorous
       tests.
    3. Add an assert in `buffer_pool_manager` to make sure the bpm
       will NOT fetch INVALID_PAGE_ID.
